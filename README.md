# Robust Face Detection and Identification

This project focuses on developing a robust face recognition system using HOG-based feature extraction and machine learning classifiers. Designed with educational website integration in mind, this system offers features such as real-time face detection, feature extraction, and efficient classification.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**: Images from three subjects were collected using a webcam (300 images per subject) under controlled lighting conditions.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing to a standard dimension (256x256 pixels).
   - Grayscale conversion to simplify image analysis.
   - Histogram equalization for enhanced contrast.
   - Median blur to reduce noise while retaining image details.
3. **Face Detection**: Used Haar Cascade Classifier for efficient and real-time detection.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Applied the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique, extracting ~15,000 features per image.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Leveraged Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize computational efficiency.
6. **Classification**: Experimented with several machine learning classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Random Forest (RF)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
